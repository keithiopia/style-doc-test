<h3 id="a-42-a-42-s">A&#42;, A&#42;s</h3>
<p>The top grade in GCSEs and A levels. Use the symbol * not the word ‘star’. No apostrophe in the plural.</p>
<h3 id="a-level">A level</h3>
<p>No hyphen. Lower case level.</p>
<h3 id="abbreviations-and-acronyms">abbreviations and acronyms</h3>
<p>The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it&rsquo;s well known, like UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT and MP. This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials, and use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown#acronyms">acronym Markdown</a> so the full explanation is available as hover text.</p>

<p>If you think an acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand and commonly use it. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.</p>

<p>Don’t use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.</p>

<p>Don’t use an acronym if you’re not going to use it again later in the text.</p>
<h3 id="the-academies-programme">the academies programme</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
<h3 id="academy">academy</h3>
<p>Only use upper case when referring to the name of an academy, like Mossbourne Community Academy. See also <a href="#titles">Titles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="academy-converters">academy converters</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
<h3 id="academy-order">academy order</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
<h3 id="academy-trust">academy trust</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
<h3 id="access-to-work">Access to Work</h3>
<p>Upper case when referring directly to the actual programme, otherwise use lower case.</p>
<h3 id="accountancy-service-provider">Accountancy Service Provider</h3>
<p>Upper case when referring to the business area covered by Money Laundering Regulations. Don&rsquo;t use the acronym.</p>
<h3 id="accounts-office">Accounts Office</h3>
<p>Upper case.</p>
<h3 id="activation-pin">Activation PIN</h3>
<p>Upper case. Activation PIN has been changed to Activation Code on outgoing correspondence from the Government Gateway. Until all hard-coded instances of Activation PIN have been removed from the Online Services pages, use &lsquo;Activation Code (also known as Activation PIN)&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="act-act-of-parliament">act, act of Parliament</h3>
<p>Lower case. Only use upper case when using the full title: Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, for example.</p>
<h3 id="active-voice">active voice</h3>
<p>Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.</p>
<h3 id="addressing-the-user">addressing the user</h3>
<p>Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action: ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’, for example.</p>
<h3 id="adoption-register">Adoption Register</h3>
<p>Upper case when referring to the national Adoption Register.</p>

<p>Lower case in subsequent mentions that don&rsquo;t use the full term: the register.</p>
<h3 id="adviser">adviser</h3>
<p>Not advisor, but advisory is the correct adjective.</p>
<h3 id="ages">ages</h3>
<p>Don’t use hyphens in ages unless to avoid confusion, although it’s always best to write in a way that avoids ambiguity. For example, ‘a class of 15 16-year-old students took the A level course’ can be written as ‘15 students aged 16 took the A level course’.</p>
<h3 id="agile">agile</h3>
<p>Upper case when referring to the Agile Manifesto and principles and processes, otherwise use lower case.</p>
<h3 id="al-qa-39-ida">al-Qa&#39;ida</h3>
<p>Not al-Qaeda&rsquo; or &#39;al-Qaida.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-provision">alternative provision</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
<h3 id="americanisms">Americanisms</h3>
<p>Don’t use Americanisms. You fill in a form, not fill out a form.</p>

<p>Exceptions include where it’s part of a specific name: 4th Mechanized Brigade, for example.</p>

<p>Use the -ise rather than -ize suffix: organise not organize, for example (this isn’t actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).</p>
<h3 id="ampersand">ampersand</h3>
<p>Use &#39;and&rsquo; rather than &amp;, unless it&rsquo;s a department&rsquo;s logo image or a company&rsquo;s name as it appears on the <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies House</a> register.</p>
