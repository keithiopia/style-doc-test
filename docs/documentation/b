<h3 id="bacs-bankers-automated-clearing-system">Bacs (Bankers Automated Clearing System)</h3>
<p>Acronym should come first as it&rsquo;s more widely known than the full name. Please note that the acronym has changed to Bacs.</p>
<h3 id="banned-words">banned words</h3>
<p>See <a href="#words-to-avoid">Words to avoid</a></p>
<h3 id="baseline">baseline</h3>
<p>One word, lower case.</p>
<h3 id="behavioural-insights-team">Behavioural Insights team</h3>
<p>Upper case if it&rsquo;s a specific, named team. Always lower case for team and generic names like research team, youth offending team.</p>
<h3 id="bereavement-payment">Bereavement Payment</h3>
<p>Upper case.</p>
<h3 id="blind-person-39-s-allowance">Blind Person&rsquo;s Allowance</h3>
<p>Upper case.</p>
<h3 id="board">board</h3>
<p>Always lower case unless it&rsquo;s part of a proper title: so upper case for the Judicial Executive Board, but lower case for the DFT&rsquo;s management board.</p>
<h3 id="bold">bold</h3>
<p>Don’t use bold. It can distract the user and it makes the text longer and more confusing for users of screen readers. Use headings or <a href="#bullet-points-steps">bullets</a> instead if you want to emphasise particular words or sections.</p>
<h3 id="borough-council">borough council</h3>
<p>Lower case even in a name: Northampton borough council.</p>
<h3 id="brackets">brackets</h3>
<p>Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t use round brackets to refer to something that could either be singular or plural, like &lsquo;Check which document(s) you need to send to DVLA.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Always use the plural instead, as this will cover each possibility: &#39;Check which documents you need to send to DVLA.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 id="britain">Britain</h3>
<p>See <a href="#great-britain">Great Britain</a></p>
<h3 id="btec-national-diploma">BTEC National Diploma</h3>
<p>Upper case.</p>
<h3 id="bullet-points-and-steps">bullet points and steps</h3>
<p>{:#bullet-points-steps}</p>

<p>You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you always use a lead-in line</li>
<li>the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line</li>
<li>you use lower case at the start of the bullet</li>
<li>you don’t use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item</li>
<li>you don’t put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets</li>
<li>if you add links they appear within the text and not as the whole bullet</li>
<li>you don&rsquo;t put a semicolon at the end of a bullet</li>
<li>there is no full stop after the last bullet point</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">steps</h4>
<p>Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You don&rsquo;t need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown#numbered-list">appropriate Markdown</a>) in steps. Steps end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.</p>
<h3 id="business-continuity-management">business continuity management</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
<h3 id="business-plan">business plan</h3>
<p>Lower case. Don’t use upper case even in the title of a business plan publication.</p>
<h3 id="business-statement">business statement</h3>
<p>Lower case.</p>
