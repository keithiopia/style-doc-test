###A&#42;, A&#42;s

The top grade in GCSEs and A levels. Use the symbol * not the word ‘star’. No apostrophe in the plural.

###A level

No hyphen. Lower case level.

###abbreviations and acronyms

The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it's well known, like UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT and MP. This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials, and use [acronym Markdown](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown#acronyms) so the full explanation is available as hover text.

If you think an acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand and commonly use it. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.

Don’t use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

Don’t use an acronym if you’re not going to use it again later in the text.

###the academies programme

Lower case.

###academy

Only use upper case when referring to the name of an academy, like Mossbourne Community Academy. See also [Titles](#titles).

###academy converters

Lower case.

###academy order

Lower case.

###academy trust

Lower case.

###Access to Work

Upper case when referring directly to the actual programme, otherwise use lower case.

###Accountancy Service Provider

Upper case when referring to the business area covered by Money Laundering Regulations. Don't use the acronym.

###Accounts Office

Upper case.

###Activation PIN

Upper case. Activation PIN has been changed to Activation Code on outgoing correspondence from the Government Gateway. Until all hard-coded instances of Activation PIN have been removed from the Online Services pages, use 'Activation Code (also known as Activation PIN)'.

###act, act of Parliament

Lower case. Only use upper case when using the full title: Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, for example.

###active voice

Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.

###addressing the user

Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action: ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’, for example.

###Adoption Register

Upper case when referring to the national Adoption Register.

Lower case in subsequent mentions that don't use the full term: the register.

###adviser

Not advisor, but advisory is the correct adjective.

###ages

Don’t use hyphens in ages unless to avoid confusion, although it’s always best to write in a way that avoids ambiguity. For example, ‘a class of 15 16-year-old students took the A level course’ can be written as ‘15 students aged 16 took the A level course’.

###agile

Upper case when referring to the Agile Manifesto and principles and processes, otherwise use lower case.

###al-Qa'ida

Not al-Qaeda' or 'al-Qaida.

###alternative provision

Lower case.

###Americanisms

Don’t use Americanisms. You fill in a form, not fill out a form.

Exceptions include where it’s part of a specific name: 4th Mechanized Brigade, for example.

Use the -ise rather than -ize suffix: organise not organize, for example (this isn’t actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).

###ampersand

Use 'and' rather than &, unless it's a department's logo image or a company's name as it appears on the [Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/) register.

###animal health

Lower case.

###antisocial

No hyphen.

###applied general qualifications

Lower case.

###apprenticeship programme

Lower case.

###A-road

Hyphenated.

###armed forces

Lower case.

###arm's length body
