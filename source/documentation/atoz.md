The style guide includes:

- GOV.UK style for specific words and phrases, in terms of spelling, hyphenation and capitalisation

If there’s a point of style that isn’t covered here, check [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a). If it isn’t there, check [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction).

You can also refer to the [Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/new-oxford-dictionary-for-writers-and-editors-9780199570010) for advice on hyphenation.
