###tax credits
Lower case and plural. Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are specific benefits, so are upper case and singular.

###tax returns

Upper case when referring to proper titles for the first time: Company Tax Return, Partnership Tax Return, Employer Annual Return.

Use Self Assessment tax return at first mention, as it’s not a proper title.

After that refer to them in full, or if it’s clear what you’re referring to, simply as a return. General references to tax returns are lower case.

When referring to the legal requirement we use deliver or file the return. Online, we say submit the return. For Self Assessment (paper or online) use send or file the return. Send is better.

###the teachers' standards

Lower case.

###teaching school

Lower case.

###team

Lower case: youth offending team, Behavioural Insights team.

###teamwork

Lower case. One word.

###tech levels

Lower case. The name given to the occupational qualifications endorsed by employers and trade associations.

###technical level qualifications

Lower case.

###TechBacc

###technical terms

Use technical terms where you need to. They're not jargon. You just need to explain what they mean the first time you use them.

###telephone numbers

Use Telephone: 011 111 111 or Mobile: - not Mob:.

Use spaces between city and local exchange. Here are the different formats to use:

01273 800 900

020 7450 4000

0800 890 567

07771 900 900

077718 300 300

+44 (0)20 7450 4000

+39 1 33 45 70 90

When a number is memorable, group the numbers into easily remembered units: 0800 80 70 60.

###temperature

Use Celsius: 37°C

###threshold assessment

Lower case.

###times

* use ‘to’ in time ranges, not hyphens, en rules or em dashes: 10am to 11am (not 10-11am)
* 5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
* midnight (not 00:00)
* midday (not 12 noon, noon or 12pm)
* 6 hours 30 minutes

Midnight is the first minute of the day, not the last. You should consider using “11:59pm” to avoid confusion about a single, specific time.

For example, “You must register by 11:59pm on Tuesday 14 June.” can only be read one way, but "You must register by midnight on Tuesday 14 June" can be read in two ways (the end of Monday 13, or end of Tuesday 14).

###Tied Oils Enquiry Service

###titles

Titles should:

* be 65 characters or less
* be unique, clear and descriptive
* be front-loaded and optimised for search
* use a colon to break up longer titles
* not contain dashes or slashes
* not have a full stop at the end
* not use acronyms unless they are well-known, like EU

###town council

Lower case, even when part of a name: Swanage town council.

###Trade marks

Trade mark is 2 words but trademarked is one word.

###Trading Standards

###Trust or Company Service Provider
